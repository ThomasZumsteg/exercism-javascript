# Hexadecimal

Write a program that will convert a hexadecimal number, represented as a string (e.g. "10af8c"), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).

On the web we use hexadecimal to represent colors, e.g. green: 008000,
teal: 008080, navy: 000080).

The program should handle invalid hexadecimal strings.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ jasmine-node .
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
